Users
=====

Users in Handshake represent an account that can be logged into and used to access the interface.

Profiles
--------

Each user account has a profile that represents who they are. Profiles can be described as a digital version of a resume. Profile content is used to easily search for students or mentors.

Building a Profile
##################

Users can add education, work experience, projects, extra curriculars, courses, skills, organizations and external links to their profile. Building a profile is done on the user's profile page.

Parsing Resume to Auto Build
############################

An option for quickly building an initial profile is through the Resume Parser. The Resume Parser will upload an uploaded resume and automatically allow you to add them to your profile.

Archived Users
--------------

Users are not deleted in Handshake; instead, they are archived. Archiving is a safer solution, and behaves the same as if they were deleted.
